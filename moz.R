#  Example to be completed in class, if there is time
#  Conduct a structured analysis using the Mosquito1 data set

#  1. Create a boxplot with the factors are ordered from smallest mean to largest

#  2. Using your understanding of the image Export options,
#  copy  the plot in an appropriate format with clearly legible scale and resolution.

#  3. Conduct a group variance test
#  save a copy of the plot in an appropriate scale and resolution.


#  4. Using the one.way function conduct an appropriate ANOVA test

#  5. Conduct appropriate pair-wise testing.

#  6.  Collate your results into a word document where you have:
#  (i)   specified an appropriate null and alternate hypothesis for each test
#         (group variance test, ANOVA test and pairwise tests)
#  (ii)  added your figure, including adding a caption label.  
#        Note: the figure should first be saved as a separate png file. 
#  (iii) Included an appropriate summary table of your pairwise results
#  (iv)  make a statement about the which insecticide(s) you would recommend 
#        Note: Lower values are preferred
#   (v)  Comment on any notable aspect of the results
